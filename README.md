Key Features:

Utilizes libraries such as sys and hashlib.

Optimized with generators and multi-threading for efficiency.


Purpose: Demonstrates Python’s ability to handle cryptographic tasks and password cracking.



---

2. SSH Login Brute-Forcing Script

A script to brute-force SSH credentials for ethical hacking and penetration testing purposes.

Key Features:

Uses Python libraries like paramiko and sys.

Handles connection timeouts and retry logic.

Includes customizable dictionaries and user-defined parameters.


Purpose: Explores automation in remote service attacks while highlighting SSH protocol vulnerabilities.

Purpose: Demonstrates Python’s utility in creating proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits.



---

4. Bind Shells (Encrypted and Unencrypted)

Unencrypted Bind Shell:

Creates a direct connection between attacker and victim.

Uses low-level socket programming for real-time communication.


Encrypted Bind Shell:

Adds encryption using libraries like cryptography for secure communication.

Demonstrates the importance of securing remote shell access.

6. Windows Keylogger

A Python-based keylogger for Windows operating systems.

Key Features:

Captures and logs keystrokes.

Sends logs to a remote server or stores them locally.

Built using libraries like pynput and os.


Purpose: Highlights the risks of keylogging and educates on countermeasures.



---

7. Remote DLL Injection

A script to perform DLL injection on remote Windows processes.

Key Features:

Demonstrates process manipulation using Python’s ctypes and win32api libraries.

Automates DLL injection for ethical testing purposes.


Purpose: Explores low-level Windows internals and the risks of DLL injection.
